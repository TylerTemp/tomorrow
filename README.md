# tomorrow

website code for [tomorrow.comes.today](http://tomorrow.comes.today) and [jolla.comes.today](http://jolla.comes.today)

Note it's developing and hasn't finished.

# Install

Require python >= 3.3 & MongoDB

It may or may not run on python2.7 (not test)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TylerTemp/tomorrow.git
cd tomorrow
pip3 install -r requirement.txt
```

# Run

run in single process:

```bash
cd path/to/tomorrow
python3 main.py -p 8000
```

# Configuration & multiprocess

run the following command to generate a `config.conf` file in the main folder

```bash
python lib/config.py
```

(this `config.conf` is in json format. Read the comment for details)

open `config.conf`, change `"ports": [8001, 8002, 8003, 8004]` to
any ports you want to run

then run multiprocess by

```bash
python3 lib/tool/reboot.py
```

Note you can shadow those settings by passing args to `main.py` or `lib/tool/reboot.py` in command line

`reboot.py` accept the same command line args except `-p`,
use `python main.py --help` for more detail
